###Why Log?
   - In a production environment (or any runtime environment) you have no way to **determine the runtime issues** other than logging.
      - Note that logs may even be coming from other libraries (like messaging systems, mail ). 
   - **Reproducing an issue** is much more **difficult** and **time consuming** than having a log of all issues faced.
